    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "**Ans:** Functions reduce the need for duplicate code and mainly udsed to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed in order to carry out a specified task.\n",
    "The main advantage of functions is code Reusability."

    "#### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "#### 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "**Ans:** A function is a block of code that does a particular operation and returns a result. It usually accepts inputs as parameters and returns a result. The parameters are not mandatory. A function call is the code used to pass control to a function. "

    "#### 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",

    "#### 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "**Ans**: A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used\n",
    "as part of an expression."

    "#### 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "**Ans:** If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is `None`."

    "#### 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "**Ans:** A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the `global` keyword to declare which variables are  global."

    "#### 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "**Ans:** Place the line of code that might cause an error in a `try` clause and use except `block` to handle the error."
